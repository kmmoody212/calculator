# Calculator

## 🗒️ Description 

This web application is a calculator that was mainly written in JavaScript, but doesn't use the insecure eval() method! Since the eval() method is known to be an insecure piece of code, I wanted to create a calculator app that didn't rely on it. Feel free to use this app for your daily math needs without worry! Bonus: while I was styling the buttons on the calculator, I unintentionally made a Hermann Grid Illusion! There aren't any dots between the buttons - or are there... 🤔??

## ❓ Why I Made This App 

I started this project after spending many months deep-diving into other coding languages. I felt like my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals was getting further away and needed to be put to the test. Making an app that is entirely based on user interaction was a blast! It was crucial to brainstorm the many different actions a person could take with a calculator - and there are many! With those numerous possible actions, I wanted to keep the code as simple and DRY as I could while still ensuring a seamless user experience.

## 👩‍🏫 What I Learned 

As cliche as it sounds, there really is more than one way to write code, and this project solidified that for me. It can be easy to get caught up in trying to write the "perfect" code right away, but all it really takes is breaking down the main components of the project into smaller tasks, writing a code that works for that task, rinse, and repeat. Bugs can always be fixed along the way!
